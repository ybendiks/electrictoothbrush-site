      <div class="quick-answer-label">Quick Answer</div>
      <p>Yes, you can — and should — use an electric toothbrush with gum recession. The key is choosing one with a <strong>pressure sensor</strong> and using <strong>extra-soft brush heads</strong>. Electric toothbrushes actually reduce the aggressive scrubbing that causes further recession. The <strong><a href="/philips-sonicare-protectiveclean-6100">Sonicare ProtectiveClean 6100</a></strong> and <strong><a href="/oral-b-io-series-5">Oral-B iO Series 5</a></strong> are our top recommendations.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Gum recession is one of the most common dental concerns, affecting roughly half of adults over 30. If your dentist has told you that your gums are receding, your first instinct might be to switch to the softest manual toothbrush you can find — or stop using an electric toothbrush altogether. But that instinct is usually wrong. Modern electric toothbrushes, when chosen and used correctly, are one of the best tools for maintaining gum health and preventing further recession.</p>

    <p>The critical factor isn't whether you use an electric or manual toothbrush — it's how much pressure you apply. And that's exactly where electric toothbrushes with pressure sensors have a significant advantage over manual brushing.</p>

    <h2>Why Gum Recession Happens</h2>
    <p>Gum recession occurs when the gum tissue that surrounds your teeth pulls back or wears away, exposing more of the tooth or even the tooth root. The most common causes include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Aggressive brushing:</strong> Pressing too hard or using a sawing motion — the single most controllable risk factor</li>
      <li><strong>Periodontal disease:</strong> Bacterial infections that destroy gum tissue and supporting bone</li>
      <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Some people are more susceptible regardless of oral hygiene habits</li>
      <li><strong>Hormonal changes:</strong> Fluctuations during pregnancy, puberty, and menopause can make gums more vulnerable</li>
      <li><strong>Tobacco use:</strong> Smoking and chewing tobacco create a sticky plaque film that accelerates gum tissue breakdown</li>
      <li><strong>Teeth grinding (bruxism):</strong> Excessive force on teeth can cause gums to recede</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Of these causes, aggressive brushing is the one you can most directly address with the right electric toothbrush. A <a href="/electric-toothbrush-clinical-evidence">2019 study in the Journal of Clinical Periodontology</a> following over 2,800 participants for 11 years found that electric toothbrush users had 22% less gum recession compared to manual brushers — largely because electric brushes deliver consistent motion without requiring the user to apply scrubbing force.</p>

    <h2>What to Look for in an Electric Toothbrush for Gum Recession</h2>
    <p>Not every electric toothbrush is equally suited for sensitive, receding gums. Here are the features that matter most:</p>

    <h3>1. Pressure Sensor (Non-Negotiable)</h3>
    <p>A pressure sensor is the single most important feature for anyone with gum recession. These sensors detect when you're pressing the brush head too firmly against your teeth and gums, then alert you through a visual signal (LED light), haptic feedback (vibration change), or by automatically reducing the motor speed. The <a href="/electric-toothbrush-with-pressure-sensor">Oral-B iO series</a> uses an LED ring that turns red when you push too hard — a clear, impossible-to-miss warning system.</p>

    <h3>2. Sensitive or Gentle Brushing Mode</h3>
    <p>Many mid-range and premium electric toothbrushes include a dedicated sensitive mode that reduces brush head speed or oscillation intensity. This is valuable during active gum treatment or when recession has exposed sensitive root surfaces. The <a href="/philips-sonicare-protectiveclean-6100">Sonicare ProtectiveClean 6100</a> goes further, offering three intensity levels within each mode.</p>

    <h3>3. Extra-Soft or Sensitive Brush Heads</h3>
    <p>Standard brush heads can be too abrasive for exposed root surfaces. Both major brands offer specialized options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sonicare:</strong> G3 Premium Gum Care head has flexible, tapered bristles that contour to the gumline. The Sensitive head is even softer.</li>
      <li><strong>Oral-B:</strong> Sensitive Clean head features ultra-thin bristles. The iO Gentle Care head is specifically designed for tender gums.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>See our complete <a href="/electric-toothbrush-heads">brush heads guide</a> for all options and compatibility information.</p>

    <h3>4. Sonic vs. Oscillating for Gum Recession</h3>
    <p>Both technologies are safe for receding gums. Sonic toothbrushes (Sonicare) vibrate at high frequency without the brush head physically rotating, which some people with recession find more comfortable. Oscillating brushes (Oral-B) have a small round head that rotates, which can feel more aggressive but isn't when used correctly with a modern pressure sensor. The <a href="/sonic-vs-electric-toothbrush">choice between sonic and oscillating</a> comes down to personal comfort.</p>

      <p>The ProtectiveClean 6100 is purpose-built for gum protection. Its pressure sensor pulses the brush to warn you when you're pushing too hard, and the three intensity levels (low, medium, high) across three modes give you nine combinations to find the exact level of gentleness your gums need. The BrushSync system automatically tracks brush head wear, ensuring you always have effective bristles. At ~$99, it's the best balance of gum-protective features and value.</p>

    <h2>Brushing Technique for Receding Gums</h2>
    <p>Having the right brush is only half the equation. Technique matters just as much:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Angle the brush at 45 degrees</strong> to the gumline — don't press straight into the teeth</li>
      <li><strong>Let the brush do the work</strong> — guide it along the gumline without applying scrubbing pressure</li>
      <li><strong>Spend 30 seconds per quadrant</strong> — use the built-in timer to avoid over-brushing any area</li>
      <li><strong>Use gentle, sweeping motions</strong> on exposed root surfaces rather than holding the brush in one spot</li>
      <li><strong>Brush gums toward the teeth</strong> — from pink to white, not the reverse</li>
    </ol>

      <div class="info-box-title">🦷 What Your Dentist Says</div>
      <p>If you have active gum recession, consult your dentist or periodontist before switching toothbrush types. They can assess the severity of your recession and recommend specific settings and brush heads. In most cases, dental professionals actively encourage patients with recession to use electric toothbrushes with pressure sensors — the consistent, controlled motion is easier to manage than manual technique, especially in areas you can't see well.</p>
