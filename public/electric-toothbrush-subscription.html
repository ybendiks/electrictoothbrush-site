<h1>Electric Toothbrush Subscription Services Compared</h1>
<div class="article-meta">

</div>

<p>Toothbrush subscription services promise to solve one of the most common oral hygiene failures: forgetting to replace your brush head. Studies show that the average person uses their brush head for 9 months instead of the recommended 3, dramatically reducing cleaning effectiveness. Subscription services deliver fresh heads to your door on a regular schedule, removing forgetfulness from the equation.</p>

<p>Three brands dominate the electric toothbrush subscription space: Quip, Burst, and Goby. Each takes a slightly different approach to pricing, product quality, and what is included. We break down every aspect to help you choose the right subscription, or decide whether you need one at all.</p>

<h2>Quip Subscription: Best for Simplicity</h2>

<p>Quip pioneered the toothbrush subscription model and remains the most popular option. Their approach centers on simplicity: a slim, minimalist brush paired with an automatic refill plan that delivers a new brush head and AAA battery every 3 months for $5.</p>

<p>The Quip brush itself is powered by a single AAA battery rather than a rechargeable cell. This might seem like a downgrade, but it has practical advantages. The battery is included in every refill shipment, so the brush always has fresh power. There is no charger to pack for travel, and the slim handle doubles as a travel case with the included wall mount cover.</p>

<p>Quip offers three tiers. The Plastic Electric starts at $25 with a sleek plastic body. The Metal Electric at $40 adds a premium aluminum handle. The Smart Electric at $75 includes Bluetooth connectivity and an app with brushing tracking. All three use the same motor and brush heads, so the subscription cost is identical regardless of which tier you choose.</p>

<p>The cleaning power of Quip is modest compared to Oral-B or Sonicare. It operates at roughly 15,000 vibrations per minute, less than half of Sonicare's output. For people switching from a manual brush, this is still a significant upgrade. For people accustomed to premium electric toothbrushes, Quip may feel underpowered.</p>

<h2>Burst Subscription: Best Brush Quality</h2>

<p>Burst targets the gap between budget subscription brushes like Quip and premium standalone brands like Sonicare. Their sonic brush delivers 33,000 vibrations per minute, matching Sonicare's output, and features charcoal-infused DuPont bristles that the company claims help reduce bacteria.</p>

<p>The Burst brush costs $70 without a subscription or $36 with a subscription commitment. This makes the subscription an excellent deal for the initial purchase, effectively cutting the brush price in half. Refills are $6 every 3 months, delivering a single brush head with free shipping.</p>

<p>What sets Burst apart is the toothbrush itself. It features 3 cleaning modes (whitening, sensitive, and massage), a long-lasting rechargeable battery that goes 4 weeks on a single charge, and a sleek matte black or white design. The charcoal bristles are a genuine differentiator, offering a gentle whitening effect that standard nylon bristles do not provide.</p>

<p>Burst is endorsed by a large network of dental professionals, and the company donates a brush to someone in need for every subscription sold. This social impact element resonates with many customers and adds value beyond the product itself.</p>

<h2>Goby Subscription: Best for Oscillating Fans</h2>

<p>Goby is the only subscription service offering an oscillating-rotating brush rather than sonic. If you prefer the round-head cleaning style of Oral-B over the elongated sonic heads of Sonicare and Burst, Goby is your best subscription option.</p>

<p>The Goby brush costs $50 to start and features a rechargeable battery, 2-minute timer, and a single cleaning mode. Refills are $6 every 3 months. The brush is well-built for its price point, with a comfortable grip and reliable motor that produces thorough oscillating action.</p>

<p>Goby's limitation is fewer features compared to Burst and less brand recognition than Quip. There is no app, no multiple cleaning modes, and no additional products in the ecosystem. For people who simply want a good oscillating brush with automatic head replacements, this streamlined approach is actually a benefit rather than a limitation.</p>

<h2>Subscription vs Traditional: Which Is Better?</h2>

<p>The honest answer depends on your habits. If you are disciplined about buying and replacing brush heads every 3 months, you can often find better deals buying heads in bulk from Amazon, especially for Oral-B and Sonicare. A 10-pack of Oral-B CrossAction heads on sale works out to about $5 per head, comparable to subscription pricing but with a superior brush.</p>

<p>If you are the type who uses a brush head until the bristles are completely flat (and statistically, most people are), a subscription forces the healthy habit of regular replacement. The heads arrive at your door, making it effortless to swap them out. This behavioral nudge is the real value of subscriptions, not necessarily the product or the price.</p>

<p>Subscription brushes also make excellent gifts. The ongoing refill plan means you are giving someone not just a toothbrush but improved oral hygiene for years to come. Quip in particular is popular as a gift due to its attractive packaging and simple setup.</p>

<div class="info-box">
  <p class="info-box-title">Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save Alternative</p>
  <p>If you prefer Oral-B or Sonicare but want automatic deliveries, Amazon Subscribe and Save offers 5% to 15% discounts on replacement heads with automatic delivery every 1 to 6 months. This gives you premium heads on a subscription schedule without committing to a specific subscription brand toothbrush.</p>
</div>

<div class="verdict-box">
  <h3>Our Recommendation</h3>
  <p><strong>Burst</strong> offers the best subscription overall, combining powerful cleaning performance with affordable refills and a well-designed brush. <strong>Quip</strong> wins for travelers and minimalists who prioritize portability and simplicity. <strong>Goby</strong> is the right choice for people who specifically prefer oscillating brushes. All three are legitimate services that deliver on their promises.</p>
