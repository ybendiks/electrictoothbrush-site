<h1>Oral-B Electric Toothbrush: Complete Brand Guide 2026</h1>

<div class="quick-answer">
<strong>Quick Summary:</strong> Oral-B is the world's most popular electric toothbrush brand, known for its clinically proven oscillating-rotating-pulsating technology. With models ranging from the $25 Vitality to the $379 iO Series 10, there is an Oral-B for every budget. The iO Series 5 ($119) is our top recommendation for most people.
</div>

<h2>The History of Oral-B</h2>

<p>Oral-B's story begins in 1950 when California periodontist Dr. Robert Hutson created a toothbrush with softer nylon bristles to be gentler on gums. The brand name "Oral-B" stood for "Oral B(rush)," and the company grew quickly as dentists began recommending the product. In 1984, Oral-B was acquired by Gillette, and the brand launched its first electric toothbrush shortly after.</p>

<p>The pivotal moment came in 1991 when German appliance company Braun partnered with Oral-B to develop electric toothbrushes, combining Braun's engineering expertise with Oral-B's dental knowledge. When Procter &amp; Gamble acquired Gillette in 2005, Oral-B became part of the P&amp;G portfolio. Today, the Oral-B brand is manufactured by Braun (a P&amp;G subsidiary) in Germany, and the "Braun electric toothbrush" name is often used interchangeably with Oral-B in many markets. This is why you will see "Braun Oral-B" on product packaging.</p>

<p>Oral-B has consistently invested in dental research, partnering with dental professionals worldwide. The brand holds numerous patents for its oscillating-rotating technology, and its products have been the subject of more than 800 clinical studies, more than any other toothbrush brand.</p>

<h2>How Oral-B Technology Works</h2>

<p>Oral-B electric toothbrushes are built around <strong>oscillating-rotating-pulsating technology</strong>. Unlike sonic toothbrushes (such as Philips Sonicare) that vibrate side to side at high frequency, Oral-B brush heads feature a small, round head that rotates clockwise and counterclockwise — oscillating back and forth — while simultaneously pulsating against teeth to loosen plaque before the rotation sweeps it away.</p>

<p>This three-dimensional cleaning action has been refined over decades. Traditional Oral-B models (Vitality, Pro, Genius) use a mechanical gear-driven motor. The newer <strong>iO Series</strong>, launched in 2020, introduced a revolutionary <strong>linear magnetic drive system</strong>. Instead of mechanical gears, the iO uses magnets to drive the brush head, resulting in smoother, quieter operation and more precise micro-vibrations that transfer energy directly to the bristle tips. Oral-B claims this delivers up to 100% more plaque removal versus a manual toothbrush.</p>

<p>The round brush head design is intentional — it cups each tooth individually, allowing the bristles to make full contact with the tooth surface and gumline. This approach differs from the elongated heads used by sonic brands, and many dentists consider both equally effective when used properly.</p>

<h2>Complete Oral-B Model Lineup</h2>

<p>Here is every current Oral-B electric toothbrush model compared side by side. The lineup splits into two main categories: the <strong>traditional series</strong> (Vitality, Pro) using mechanical motors, and the <strong>iO series</strong> using the newer magnetic drive technology.</p>

<h2>Traditional Series vs. iO Series</h2>

<p>The most important decision when choosing an Oral-B toothbrush is whether to go with a <strong>traditional model</strong> (Vitality, Pro 500, Pro 1000, Genius X) or an <strong>iO model</strong> (Series 2 through Series 10). Here is what separates them:</p>

<p>Traditional models use a proven mechanical motor with gears that has been refined over 30 years. They are louder, have a more pronounced vibration feel, and use standard Oral-B brush heads that are widely available and affordable ($4-7 each). These models get the job done without frills.</p>

<p>The iO series represents a complete redesign. The linear magnetic drive delivers energy more efficiently to the bristle tips, resulting in a noticeably smoother, quieter brushing experience. The iO handle is sleeker and more premium-feeling. However, iO brush heads use a different magnetic attachment system and cost more ($8-12 each). They are not compatible with traditional Oral-B brush heads.</p>

<p>In practical terms, both systems clean teeth effectively. The iO series provides a more pleasant, luxury experience that may encourage better brushing habits. If you are upgrading from a manual toothbrush, either system will be a significant improvement.</p>

<h2>Which Oral-B Should I Buy? Decision Guide</h2>

<div class="info-box">
<h3>Best for Tight Budgets: Oral-B Pro 1000 ($49)</h3>
<p>The Pro 1000 gives you Oral-B's proven oscillating-rotating-pulsating cleaning plus a pressure sensor, all for under $50. Brush heads are inexpensive and easy to find. If you want effective electric brushing without spending a lot, this is the one to get.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
<h3>Best Value Overall: Oral-B iO Series 5 ($119)</h3>
<p>The sweet spot in the iO lineup. You get the premium magnetic drive, five cleaning modes, an LED display showing your current mode, pressure sensor feedback, and smartphone app connectivity. It delivers 90% of the flagship experience at a fraction of the price.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
<h3>Best Premium: Oral-B iO Series 9 ($299)</h3>
<p>The Series 9 is the flagship for those who want everything. Seven cleaning modes, a beautiful color OLED display with interactive coaching, AI-powered 3D tracking that maps which zones of your mouth you have covered, and a premium magnetic travel case. It is the ultimate brushing experience.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
<h3>Best for Tech Enthusiasts: Oral-B iO Series 10 ($379)</h3>
<p>The newest and most advanced Oral-B. Its standout feature is the iO Sense charging stand with a built-in display that provides real-time coaching guidance, speed recommendations, and even a timer widget visible from across the bathroom. It is overkill for most, but tech lovers will appreciate the innovation.</p>
</div>

<h2>Oral-B Brush Head Compatibility</h2>

<p>This is a critical detail many buyers miss. Oral-B has <strong>two incompatible brush head systems</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Standard Oral-B heads</strong> — Fit Vitality, Pro 500, Pro 1000, Pro 3000, Genius, Smart, and all older models. These snap on with a mechanical click.</li>
<li><strong>iO Series heads</strong> — Fit ONLY iO Series 2 through Series 10. These attach magnetically and have a completely different design.</li>
</ul>

<p>Standard brush heads are more affordable and widely available in stores. iO brush heads cost more but are designed to work with the magnetic drive for optimal performance. For a full guide, see our <a href="/oral-b-electric-toothbrush-heads">Oral-B brush heads guide</a>.</p>
