<h1>Are Electric Toothbrushes FSA Eligible? What You Need to Know</h1>
<div class="article-meta"><span class="article-meta-item">By ElectricToothbrush.site Editorial Team</span><span class="article-meta-item last-updated">Updated: February 2026</span></div>

<div class="quick-answer">
<span class="quick-answer-label">Short Answer</span>
<p>In most cases, electric toothbrushes are <strong>not</strong> automatically FSA or HSA eligible. They are classified as general health and wellness items. However, if your dentist provides a Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN) stating an electric toothbrush is required for a specific dental condition, you may be able to use FSA/HSA funds.</p>
</div>

<p>If you have money sitting in a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) or Health Savings Account (HSA), you might be wondering whether you can put it toward a high-quality electric toothbrush. The rules around dental products and these tax-advantaged accounts can be confusing, so let us break down exactly what qualifies, what does not, and how you might get your electric toothbrush covered.</p>

<div class="section-divider"></div>

<h2>Understanding FSA and HSA Eligibility</h2>

<h3>What is an FSA?</h3>
<p>A Flexible Spending Account (FSA) is a tax-advantaged account offered through employer benefit plans. You contribute pre-tax dollars during open enrollment, and those funds can be used for qualified medical expenses throughout the plan year. FSA funds typically expire at year-end or with a small grace period, meaning "use it or lose it."</p>

<h3>What is an HSA?</h3>
<p>A Health Savings Account (HSA) is available to individuals enrolled in high-deductible health plans. Like FSAs, contributions are pre-tax, but HSA funds roll over year to year and can even be invested. The eligibility rules for what you can purchase are similar to FSA.</p>

<h3>The IRS Standard</h3>
<p>The IRS determines what qualifies as a reimbursable medical expense under Section 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. To be eligible, an item must be "primarily for the prevention or alleviation of a physical defect or illness." General health items that are also used by healthy individuals, such as regular toothbrushes and toothpaste, typically do not qualify.</p>

<div class="section-divider"></div>

<h2>Why Electric Toothbrushes Usually Do Not Qualify</h2>

<p>Electric toothbrushes fall into a gray area. While they provide measurable health benefits, including better plaque removal and gum health, they are classified as general hygiene products rather than medical devices. The key distinction the IRS makes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>General health items:</strong> Products that benefit overall health but are not treating a specific condition (toothbrushes, vitamins, gym memberships) are NOT eligible.</li>
<li><strong>Medical necessities:</strong> Products prescribed or recommended to treat a diagnosed medical condition ARE eligible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because anyone can benefit from an electric toothbrush regardless of their dental health, it defaults to the "general health" category.</p>

<div class="section-divider"></div>

<h2>How to Get Your Electric Toothbrush Covered</h2>

<p>There is a pathway to FSA/HSA eligibility: obtaining a <strong>Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN)</strong> from your dentist or physician. Here is how the process works:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Talk to Your Dentist</h3>
<p>At your next dental appointment, discuss whether an electric toothbrush would be medically necessary for your specific situation. Common qualifying conditions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Periodontal disease (gum disease):</strong> Electric toothbrushes are clinically proven to be more effective at removing plaque along the gum line.</li>
<li><strong>Arthritis or limited manual dexterity:</strong> Patients who cannot effectively use a manual toothbrush due to physical limitations.</li>
<li><strong>Post-surgical care:</strong> After dental implants, gum surgery, or jaw surgery where precise, gentle cleaning is required.</li>
<li><strong>Orthodontic treatment:</strong> Braces and other orthodontic devices that make manual brushing difficult.</li>
<li><strong>Disability or motor impairments:</strong> Any condition that affects the ability to perform effective manual brushing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: Obtain the Letter</h3>
<p>Ask your dentist to write a formal Letter of Medical Necessity that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patient name and date of birth</li>
<li>Specific diagnosis or condition</li>
<li>Explanation of why an electric toothbrush is medically necessary (not just beneficial)</li>
<li>Duration of need (ongoing or temporary)</li>
<li>Provider signature and credentials</li>
<li>Written on official practice letterhead</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Purchase and Submit</h3>
<ol>
<li>Purchase the electric toothbrush (keep the receipt)</li>
<li>Submit a claim to your FSA/HSA administrator with the receipt and LMN</li>
<li>If using an FSA debit card, you may need to submit documentation after the purchase for substantiation</li>
</ol>

<div class="info-box">
<div class="info-box-title">Important Note About FSA Stores</div>
<p>Some online "FSA stores" (like FSAstore.com) sell electric toothbrushes directly. However, the fact that a product is sold on an FSA store does not guarantee your specific plan will reimburse it. Always check with your plan administrator about their eligibility rules. Some employers have broader or narrower definitions of eligible expenses.</p>

<h2>What Dental Items ARE FSA/HSA Eligible?</h2>

<p>While standard electric toothbrushes may not qualify automatically, many dental items do:</p>

<table class="specs-table">
<thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>FSA/HSA Eligible?</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Dental cleanings</td><td><span class="table-check">&#10003;</span> Yes</td><td>Preventive care qualifies</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dental X-rays</td><td><span class="table-check">&#10003;</span> Yes</td><td>Diagnostic procedures qualify</td></tr>
<tr><td>Orthodontic treatment</td><td><span class="table-check">&#10003;</span> Yes</td><td>Braces, retainers, Invisalign</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dentures</td><td><span class="table-check">&#10003;</span> Yes</td><td>Including repairs</td></tr>
<tr><td>Prescription toothpaste</td><td><span class="table-check">&#10003;</span> Yes</td><td>Rx fluoride toothpaste only</td></tr>
<tr><td>Regular toothpaste</td><td><span class="table-cross">&#10007;</span> No</td><td>General health item</td></tr>
<tr><td>Electric toothbrush</td><td>Maybe</td><td>Requires LMN</td></tr>
<tr><td>Replacement brush heads</td><td>Maybe</td><td>If brush was approved with LMN</td></tr>
<tr><td>Water flosser</td><td>Maybe</td><td>Requires LMN for gum disease</td></tr>
<tr><td>Manual toothbrush</td><td><span class="table-cross">&#10007;</span> No</td><td>General health item</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mouthwash (OTC)</td><td><span class="table-cross">&#10007;</span> No</td><td>Unless prescribed</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<div class="section-divider"></div>

<h2>Spending FSA Funds Before They Expire</h2>

<p>If you have leftover FSA funds approaching the deadline, here are better-guaranteed dental expenses to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule any outstanding dental work (fillings, crowns, cleanings)</li>
<li>Get prescription-strength fluoride toothpaste from your dentist</li>
<li>Purchase prescription mouthwash (chlorhexidine)</li>
<li>Stock up on clearly eligible dental supplies your plan covers</li>
<li>Consider an additional dental cleaning if your plan covers it</li>
</ul>

<div class="verdict-box">
<h3>Our Recommendation</h3>
<p>If you have a legitimate dental condition that makes an electric toothbrush medically necessary, absolutely pursue the LMN route. Many dentists are happy to write these letters when there is genuine medical justification. However, do not count on FSA/HSA funds for a toothbrush purchase unless you have confirmed eligibility with your plan administrator first. The best electric toothbrushes are worth the out-of-pocket investment regardless.</p>
