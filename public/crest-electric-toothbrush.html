<h1>Crest Electric Toothbrush: The Spinbrush Story and What to Buy Instead</h1>

<div class="quick-answer">
<strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Crest does not currently sell electric toothbrushes. The Crest Spinbrush was sold to Church &amp; Dwight around 2012 and now sells as simply "Spinbrush." Crest and Oral-B are both Procter &amp; Gamble brands, with Oral-B handling all electric toothbrush products. If you're looking for a "Crest electric toothbrush," you want an Oral-B. If you want the old Spinbrush, it's still available as a budget battery-powered option ($5-8).
</div>

<h2>The Crest and Oral-B Connection</h2>

<p>If you've been searching for a "Crest electric toothbrush," you're not alone. Crest is one of the most recognized names in oral care, and many people naturally assume the brand offers electric toothbrushes. Understanding the relationship between Crest and Oral-B clarifies why Crest doesn't make electric brushes and where to look instead.</p>

<p>Both Crest and Oral-B are owned by Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G), the consumer goods giant. Within the P&amp;G portfolio, the brands have clearly defined roles. Crest handles toothpaste, mouthwash, whitening strips, and other chemical-based oral care products. Oral-B handles toothbrushes, both manual and electric, as well as dental floss and brush-related accessories. This brand separation means Crest won't be entering the electric toothbrush market since Oral-B already fills that role within the same parent company.</p>

<p>In practice, this means Crest toothpaste and Oral-B toothbrushes are designed to work together, even though they carry different brand names. P&amp;G often sells them as companion products, and many dentists recommend using Crest toothpaste with an Oral-B electric toothbrush as a complete system.</p>

<h2>The History of the Crest Spinbrush</h2>

<p>The Crest Spinbrush has an interesting history. Originally invented by four entrepreneurs in Cleveland, Ohio, the Spinbrush was designed to be the first affordable battery-powered toothbrush, priced at just $5. The inventors sold the product to Procter &amp; Gamble in 2001, and P&amp;G marketed it under the Crest brand as the "Crest Spinbrush."</p>

<p>The Crest Spinbrush was a massive commercial success, becoming one of the best-selling toothbrushes in America. Its key innovation wasn't technological sophistication but rather accessibility: it made powered brushing available at a price point where anyone could try it. The spinning brush head and AA battery power source were simple, but they represented a meaningful upgrade from manual brushing for millions of consumers.</p>

<p>Around 2012, Procter &amp; Gamble sold the Spinbrush brand to Church &amp; Dwight, the company behind Arm &amp; Hammer. The product was rebranded as simply "Spinbrush" without the Crest name and continues to be sold today. Meanwhile, P&amp;G focused its electric toothbrush efforts on the more profitable Oral-B brand.</p>

<h2>What You Should Buy Instead</h2>

<p>If you came to this page looking for a Crest-branded electric toothbrush, here are the options you should actually consider, starting from the most affordable to premium.</p>

<p>For budget buyers ($30-50), the Oral-B Pro 1000 offers real oscillating-rotating cleaning power, a built-in pressure sensor, and a 2-minute timer. It's essentially what a "Crest electric toothbrush" would be if Crest made one, since both brands are part of the P&amp;G family. The Sonicare 4100 is an excellent sonic alternative at the same price point.</p>

<p>For mid-range buyers ($50-120), the Oral-B iO Series 4 or 5 provides magnetic drive technology, multiple cleaning modes, and significantly better cleaning than any battery-powered brush. These models represent the sweet spot of performance and value in the Oral-B lineup.</p>

<p>For premium buyers ($200+), the Oral-B iO Series 9 offers the most advanced brushing technology available, including AI-powered tracking, a color OLED display, and 7 cleaning modes. Pair it with Crest Pro-Health toothpaste for the full P&amp;G oral care experience.</p>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Best P&amp;G Combo:</strong> For the complete Procter &amp; Gamble oral care experience, pair an Oral-B iO electric toothbrush with Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and Oral-B Glide floss. These products are designed within the same company and work together as a comprehensive dental care system.
</div>

<h2>Why the Brand Confusion Exists</h2>

<p>The confusion between Crest and Oral-B is partly P&amp;G's doing. For years, the company marketed both brands together, and many product bundles include both Crest toothpaste and Oral-B toothbrushes in the same packaging. Shoppers naturally associate both brands with the same product category, leading to searches for "Crest electric toothbrush" when what they want is an Oral-B.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Crest Spinbrush's decade-long run from 2001 to around 2012 created lasting brand association. People who grew up using a "Crest electric toothbrush" may not realize the product was sold and rebranded years ago.</p>

<div class="verdict-box">
<h3>Our Verdict</h3>
<p>There's no Crest electric toothbrush to recommend because Crest doesn't make one. For the product you're actually looking for, head to our Oral-B electric toothbrush guide for the full range of options from budget to premium. If you specifically want the old Crest Spinbrush, it's available as "Spinbrush" for $5-8, but we recommend investing in a proper rechargeable brush for meaningfully better oral care.</p>
