<h2>Design and First Impressions</h2>

<p>The Colgate Hum makes a strong first impression with its modern, colorful design. Available in purple, blue, and teal, it looks distinctly different from the clinical white-and-gray aesthetic of most electric toothbrushes. The matte-finish handle has a comfortable grip with a soft-touch surface, and the overall shape is slim enough to feel natural in your hand.</p>

<p>The button layout is simple: one power button cycles through the three cleaning modes. A small LED ring around the button indicates which mode is active and shows battery level. The charging base (included with the $70 rechargeable version) is compact and unobtrusive on a bathroom counter.</p>

<p>The brush head uses Colgate's tapered bristle design with an integrated tongue and cheek cleaner on the back, which is a nice touch borrowed from their popular manual toothbrush designs. Replacement heads are available in packs of two and click securely onto the handle.</p>

<h2>Smart Features and App Experience</h2>

<p>The Hum's app is where Colgate really put their effort, and it shows. After a quick Bluetooth pairing, the app displays a 3D model of your mouth divided into zones. As you brush, sensors in the handle track your movements and the app highlights each zone in real time, turning from gray to a color as you clean each area adequately.</p>

<p>This zone-by-zone guidance is genuinely helpful for people who tend to rush through certain areas of their mouth. The app also scores each brushing session on a scale of 0-100, factoring in coverage, duration, and technique. Over time, you can see trends in your brushing performance and identify areas you consistently miss.</p>

<p>The frequency tracking feature records when you brush and builds a streak calendar similar to fitness apps. For people trying to establish or maintain a twice-daily brushing habit, this visual tracking provides motivation. Colgate also integrates occasional tips and oral care education into the app experience.</p>

<h2>Cleaning Performance in Practice</h2>

<p>In daily use, the Hum delivers adequate but not exceptional cleaning performance. The sonic vibrations feel moderate, providing a noticeable step up from manual brushing but lacking the intensity you'd feel from a Sonicare ProtectiveClean or Oral-B Pro 1000. The three cleaning modes offer meaningful variety: Normal is suitable for daily use, Sensitive provides a gentler option for people with gum tenderness, and Deep Clean increases intensity for a more thorough session.</p>

<p>The brush head design works well, with the tapered bristles reaching between teeth effectively. The integrated tongue cleaner on the back of the head is a practical addition that many users appreciate. After two weeks of testing, teeth feel clean and gums are healthy, though the "wow factor" of cleanliness that premium electric toothbrushes deliver is less pronounced.</p>

<h2>Battery Versions: Rechargeable vs Battery-Powered</h2>

<p>Colgate offers the Hum in two versions. The rechargeable model ($70) includes a USB charging base and delivers approximately 10 days of battery life per charge. The battery-powered version ($20) uses a single AA battery and lasts about 3 months. Both versions include the same Bluetooth smart features and app connectivity.</p>

<p>The battery-powered Hum is one of the best values in the smart toothbrush market. At $20, you get Bluetooth tracking, 3 cleaning modes, and Colgate's zone guidance at a price lower than most basic electric toothbrushes. The trade-off is the minor inconvenience of replacing batteries and a slightly thicker handle to accommodate the AA cell.</p>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you're on a budget but want smart features, the $20 battery-powered Hum is arguably the best value in the entire smart toothbrush category. You get the same app features as the rechargeable version at a fraction of the cost.
</div>

<h2>Who Should Buy the Colgate Hum</h2>

<p>The Colgate Hum is best suited for first-time electric toothbrush buyers who want smart guidance at an accessible price point. If you've been using a manual toothbrush and want technology to help improve your brushing technique without spending $200 or more on a premium smart brush, the Hum delivers genuine value.</p>

<p>It's also a good choice for younger users (teens and college students) who are drawn to the modern design and gamified app experience. The brushing score and streak tracking tap into the same psychological motivators that make fitness trackers effective.</p>

<p>However, the Hum is not the right choice if you need maximum cleaning power for heavy plaque or gum disease, if you want a long-lasting battery for travel, or if you're experienced with electric toothbrushes and have expectations set by premium Oral-B or Sonicare models.</p>

<div class="verdict-box">
<h3>Our Verdict</h3>
<p>The Colgate Hum delivers smart toothbrush features at a price that makes them accessible to a much wider audience. The app guidance is genuinely useful, the design is appealing, and the battery-powered version at $20 is a remarkable value. Where the Hum falls short is cleaning power compared to dedicated electric toothbrush brands. We rate it 3.8/5 as a solid entry-level smart toothbrush that prioritizes guidance over raw performance.</p>
