<h1>BURST Electric Toothbrush Review: Dental Hygienist Favorite Worth the Hype?</h1>

<div class="quick-answer">
<strong>Quick Answer:</strong> The BURST Sonic Toothbrush ($69) is a direct-to-consumer sonic electric toothbrush featuring charcoal-infused bristles, 33,000 vibrations per minute, and a subscription model for replacement heads ($6 every 3 months). It's heavily endorsed by dental hygienists and offers solid mid-range performance. While it can't quite match the cleaning power of premium Oral-B or Sonicare models, it provides genuine value at its price point.

<h2>What Is BURST?</h2>

<p>BURST (stylized in all caps) is a direct-to-consumer oral care brand that launched with a mission to make quality dental products accessible outside of traditional retail markup. The company sells primarily through its website and through dental professional referrals, cutting out retail middlemen to offer competitive pricing.</p>

<p>What sets BURST apart from other DTC oral care brands like Quip is its focus on dental professional endorsement. BURST has built an ambassador program of over 25,000 dental hygienists and dentists who recommend the brush to their patients. This grassroots approach through dental offices has given BURST a credibility that many DTC brands struggle to achieve.</p>

<h2>The Charcoal Bristle Difference</h2>

<p>BURST's signature feature is its charcoal-infused Binchotan bristles. Binchotan is a type of activated charcoal from Japan that has been used for centuries for water purification and various health applications. In a toothbrush, the charcoal is embedded in the nylon bristle fibers rather than being a surface coating.</p>

<p>The claimed benefits of charcoal bristles include natural antibacterial properties, reduced odor-causing bacteria, and mild whitening through gentle surface stain absorption. In practice, the charcoal in the bristles is unlikely to provide dramatic benefits beyond what good sonic cleaning delivers. The real cleaning power comes from the 33,000 vibrations per minute, not the bristle material.</p>

<p>That said, the BURST brush heads are genuinely well-made. The bristles are soft yet effective, with tapered tips that reach between teeth. Many users report that the bristles feel gentler on gums than standard nylon while still providing thorough cleaning. Whether that's due to the charcoal infusion or simply good bristle engineering is debatable, but the end result is positive.</p>

<h2>Cleaning Performance</h2>

<p>At 33,000 vibrations per minute, BURST falls between Quip (15,000) and Sonicare (31,000) in terms of raw sonic power. In practical use, the BURST delivers a satisfying cleaning experience that clearly outperforms budget options and comes reasonably close to the Sonicare ProtectiveClean range.</p>

<p>The three cleaning modes provide some variety, though the differences between them are subtler than you might expect. Whitening mode runs at full power, Sensitive reduces intensity for tender gums, and Massage provides a pulsing rhythm that some users find pleasant for gum stimulation. Most people will settle on one mode and rarely switch.</p>

<p>The 2-minute timer with 30-second quadrant pacer works exactly as expected, buzzing briefly every 30 seconds to remind you to move to the next section of your mouth. This is an essential feature that ensures you're brushing for the dentist-recommended duration.</p>

<h2>The BURST Subscription Model</h2>

<p>BURST's subscription delivers replacement brush heads every 3 months for $6 per head, which is among the most affordable replacement head programs in the industry. For comparison, Oral-B replacement heads cost $6-12 each, and Sonicare heads range from $8-15 each. BURST's pricing is competitive with even the cheapest third-party replacement heads.</p>

<p>The subscription is optional. You can purchase replacement heads individually for $7.99 each without subscribing. However, the subscription pricing makes it a no-brainer for most users, and the automatic delivery ensures you're replacing your brush head on schedule.</p>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Subscription Cost Breakdown:</strong> BURST subscription heads cost $6 every 3 months, totaling $24/year in replacement heads. That's approximately half the cost of name-brand Sonicare or Oral-B replacement heads, making BURST one of the most affordable electric toothbrush ecosystems to maintain.
</div>

<h2>Design and Build Quality</h2>

<p>The BURST Sonic Toothbrush features a sleek matte black design (also available in white and rose gold) with a slim, ergonomic handle. The build quality is solid for the price, with a rubber grip section that prevents slipping in wet hands. The brush feels more premium than its $69 price suggests.</p>

<p>Battery life is a genuine standout. BURST claims up to 4 weeks on a single charge, and in our testing, we consistently achieved 3.5-4 weeks of twice-daily use. This makes BURST one of the best options for travelers who don't want to pack a charger for shorter trips.</p>

<h2>Who Should Buy BURST</h2>

<p>BURST is ideal for people who want solid sonic cleaning without paying premium brand prices. If your dental hygienist recommended BURST, there's good reason to trust that endorsement since dental professionals are well-positioned to evaluate cleaning effectiveness. The long battery life makes it especially appealing for travelers, and the affordable subscription keeps ongoing costs low.</p>

<p>However, if you need a pressure sensor to protect sensitive gums, or if you want the proven oscillating-rotating technology of Oral-B, BURST may not be the best fit. It also lacks the smart features that some users find motivating.</p>

<div class="verdict-box">
<h3>Our Verdict</h3>
<p>BURST delivers genuine value in the mid-range electric toothbrush market. The combination of solid sonic cleaning, excellent battery life, and affordable replacement heads makes it a smart purchase for budget-conscious buyers who want more than entry-level performance. The charcoal bristles are more marketing than substance, but the brush itself is well-engineered. We rate it 4.0/5 as a strong mid-range option.</p>
